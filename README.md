# Drake

Drake is a simple-to-use, extensible, text-based data workflow tool that organizes command execution around data and its dependencies. Data processing steps are defined along with their inputs and outputs and Drake automatically resolves their dependencies and calculates:

 * which commands to execute (based on file timestamps)
 * in what order to execute the commands (based on dependencies)

Drake is similar to _GNU Make_, but designed especially for data workflow management. It has HDFS support, allows multiple inputs and outputs, and includes a host of features designed to help you bring sanity to your otherwise chaotic data processing workflows.

## Installation

You will need to have a JVM installed. Drake has been tested under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows 8.
We've not tested it on other operating systems.

### Download or build the uberjar

You can build Drake from source, which is the preferred way to run the most
up-to-date version, or you can
[download a prebuilt uberjar](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=nT8F&id=0B2xtKcFEL6wwWnRzVzRZcGFFaWc)

,which may not be the most recent version of Drake.

Following are instructions for building from source. Drake is a Clojure project, so you will need to have [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

#### Clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Factual/drake.git
$ cd drake
```

#### Build the uberjar:

```bash
$ lein uberjar
```

### Run Drake from the uberjar

Once you've built or downloaded the uberjar, you can run Drake like this:

```bash
$ java -jar drake.jar
```

You can pass in arguments and options to Drake by putting them at the end of the above command, e.g.:

```bash
$ java -jar drake.jar --version
```

### Use Drake as a Clojure library

You can programmatically use Drake from your Clojure project by using [Drake's Clojure front end](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki/A-Clojure-Frontend-to-Drake). Your project.clj dependencies should include the latest Drake library, e.g.:

```clojure
[factual/drake "0.1.6"]
```

### A nicer way to run Drake

For command line usage, we provided a handy [bash script for drake](http://github.com/Factual/drake/blob/master/bin/drake). You can do either of following
 * Get the script and drake jar, set jar folder as $DRAKE_HOME
 * Clone the repo and run script from {project_root}/bin. If you make a symlink, set $DRAKE_HOME to project root folder, now you can just type `drake` to run Drake from anywhere. (You may also need leiningen installed for building uberjar.)

### Faster startup time

The JVM startup time can be a nuisance. To reduce startup time, we recommend using the way cool [Drip](https://github.com/flatland/drip). Please see [the Drake with Drip](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki/Faster-startup:-Drake-with-Drip) wiki page.

## Basic Usage

Drake documentation refers to running Drake as "drake". If you are instead running the uberjar, just replace "drake" with "java -jar drake.jar" in the examples.

The [wiki](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki) is the home for Drake's documentation, but here are simple notes on usage:

To build a specific target (and any out-of-date dependencies, if necessary):

```bash
$ drake mytarget
```

To build a target and everything that depends on it (a.k.a. "down-tree" mode):

```bash
$ drake ^mytarget
```

To build a specific target only, without any dependencies, up or down the tree:

```bash
$ drake =mytarget
```

To force build a target:

```bash
$ drake +mytarget
```

To force build a target and all its downtree dependencies:

```bash
$ drake +^mytarget
```

To force build the entire workflow:

```bash
$ drake +...
```

To exclude targets:

```bash
$ drake ... -sometarget -anothertarget
```

By default, Drake will look for `./Drakefile`. The simplest way to run your workflow is to name your workflow file `Drakefile`, and make sure you're in the same directory. Then, simply:

```bash
$ drake
```

To specify the workflow file explicitly, use `-w` or `--workflow`. E.g.:

```bash
$ drake -w /myworkflow/my-workflow.drake
```

Use `drake --help` for the full list of options.

## Documentation, etc.

The [wiki](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki) is the home for Drake's documentation.

A lot of work went into designing and specifying Drake. To prove it, here's [the 60 page specification and user manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bF-OKNLIG10v_lMes_m4yyaJtAaJKtdK0Jizvi_MNsg/edit). It's stored in Google Docs, and we encourage everyone to use its superb commenting feature to provide feedback. Just select the text you want to comment on, and click Insert -> Comment (Ctrl + Alt + M on Windows, Cmd + Option + M on Mac). It can also be downloaded as a PDF.

There are annotated workflow examples in the demos directory.

There's a [Google Group for Drake](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/drake-workflow) where you can ask questions. And if you found a bug or want to submit a feature request, go to [Drake's GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Factual/drake/issues?sort=created&state=open).

## Asynchronous Execution of Steps

Please see [the wiki page on async](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki/Async-Execution-of-Steps).

## Plugins

Drake has a plugin mechanism, allowing developers to publish and use custom plugins that extend Drake. See the [Plugin wiki page](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki/Plugins) for details.

## HDFS Compatibility

Drake provides HDFS support by allowing you to specify inputs and outputs like `hdfs:/my/big_file.txt`.

If you plan to use Drake with HDFS, please see [the wiki page on HDFS Compatibility](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki/HDFS-Compatibility).

## Amazon S3 Compatibility

Thanks to [Chris Howe](https://github.com/howech), Drake now has basic compatibility with Amazon S3 by allowing you to specify
inputs and outputs like `s3://bucket/path/to/object`.

If you plan to use Drake with S3, please see [the wiki doc on S3 Compatibility](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki/S3-Compatibility).

## Drake on the REPL

You can use Drake from your Clojure REPL, via `drake.core/run-workflow`. Please see [the Drake on the REPL wiki page](https://github.com/Factual/drake/wiki/Drake-on-the-REPL) for more details.

## Stuff outside this repo
