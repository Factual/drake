  "This module implement target dependencies and selection.

  The main function is select-steps, and targets are represented
  as structured described in process-qualifiers documentation.
  The process begins by creating these target structures from target
  strings (^A, +B, -^C etc.), then matching each target against the steps
  (each target can match multiple steps, for example, in regexp matching),
  and then expanding each step according to its tree mode (down-tree, up-tree
  or this step only).

  Then this final big list of steps is processed one-by-one to make sure
  dependants are always run after their dependencies, as well as process
  exclusions (see add-step function)."
