  "This namespace is responsible for the overall parsing of a .d file into
   a standard 'parse tree'. Contains the top level logic to take a .d file name,
   or a string, and produce the fully parsed parse tree that
   contains all the data necessary to later execute the steps.
   See parse-file and parse-str.

   The top level parse tree will look like:

   {:steps [step1 step2 ...]         ;; see below
    :vars  { ... } }                 ;; same as individual step's vars

   The most important aspect in the parse tree is the collection of parsed
   steps. Each step will contain all data about that step, including commands,
   outputs, inputs, vars, etc.

   Each step will look like:

   {:outputs        ['/tmp/base/A', '/tmp/base/B']
    :raw-outputs    ['A', 'B']
    :output-tags    ['usa-files']
    :inputs         ['/tmp/base/C']
    :input-tags     ['setup']
      ;; vector of strings
    :cmds           ['cp $INPUT $OUTPUT' 'wc -l $OUTPUT']
      ;; all available variable context for this particular step
    :vars           {'BASE' '/tmp/base/'
                     'MYVAR' 'myvalue'}
      ;; directory for step's intermediate files and logs
      ;; based on output files and output tags, created under --tmpdir
    :dir            'A_B_use-files'
   }

   At this stage, no string substitution have been performed except in
   variables. The Clojure extension code can operate on this parse tree,
   for example, by copying some steps and modifying inputs or outputs,
   or inserting new variables into :vars. All other string substitutions
   (inputs, outputs, tags, command lines) are performed at later stages.
   This is done deliberately to make writing Clojure-extensions easier.

   After parsing is done, variable string substitution is performed on this
   data structure, and step dependencies are calculated and added to each step,
   expressed as vectors of step indexes in the :steps vector of the parse tree:

   { :parents   [ 0 1 ]             ;; step's dependencies
     :children  [ 4 ]               ;; step's dependants
   }

   Also, on the top level of the parse-tree, the following maps are build
   used for target lookup:
   {
      ;; maps all outputs to steps producing them
    :output-map  { 'A' [ 0 2 ] 'B' [ 1 ] }
      ;; same for output tags
    :output-tags-map { 'tag-all' [ 0 1 2 ] 'tag-stats' [ 4 ] }
   }

   ===========================================

   This parser for Drake is built using FnParse 2
   (https://github.com/joshua-choi/fnparse/wiki)
   Using a parser combinator methodology, Rules can be easily composed to
   build up more complicated rules. Here, each character is considered a
   token, as opposed to using a lexer to tokenize before applying the parser.

   Rule naming conventions:
     1. If it ends with \"line\" or \"lines\", then it is expected to start
        at column 0 and end with a line-break character. Each \"line\" can
        have optional trailing whitespace and/or comments."
