                    the child process is written to each of the objects

                    it as a string, or System/out to use the current stdout.
                    Example:
                      (let [w (java.io.StringWriter.)]

                      )
                    The default value for this parameter is [System/out].
     :err           Same for standard error.
     :env           New environment.
     :replace-env   If true, replaces the existing environment,
                    adds by default.
     :die           Throws an exception if the exit code is non-zero.
     :use-shell     If true, use system's shell to run the provided command.
                    The command and all its argument are concatenated via
                    a space and given to $SHELL -c.
     :no-stdin      Do not redirect stdin to the child process

   Returns the child process' exit code.
